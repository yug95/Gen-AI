Beneath the sun on grassy ground,
A leather ball makes thudding sound.
Willow meets it with sweet grace,
As fielders dart from place to place.

The bowler’s eyes, a burning fire,
A run-up filled with fierce desire.
He hurls the storm, the batter waits,
In that one beat, collide their fates.

The crowd erupts, a six is flown,
Like meteor from hands unknown.
Or silence falls, a stumping neat—
The bails lift off, a swift defeat.

It’s not just sport, it’s art and war,
A battle etched in every score.
With heart and sweat and team held tight,
They chase the day, they chase the night.

So here’s to cricket—game of soul,
Where dreams are pitched and stories roll.
In every match, a tale is spun—
Of grit, of glory, and battles won.
